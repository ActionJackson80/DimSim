   - Please check the location of OpenOffice installed location,
	

Note: 
	1. If you have version lower that 1.6 then you need to install v1.6.
	2. The below open office pack also has jre along with it. If jre v1.6 is already installed then remove 
	   the jre rpm from this pack before you use it for open office installation. 

c) Recomended Install: 

Please go to the below URL to download and install OpenOffice v3.0
        
	http://mirrors.isc.org/pub/openoffice/stable/3.0.0/OOo_3.0.0_LinuxIntel_install_wJRE_en-US.tar.gz

	Type echo $JAVA_HOME
	You should get 
	/usr/bin/java
	
	Some time java -version shows lower version even after installing newer version. This is because newer java is not in the system path. 
	you can locate jre1.6 by the following command
	
	[root@localhost nginx]# find / -name java | grep /bin/java | grep jre | grep 1.6
	
	It will show output similar to 
	
	[root@localhost nginx]# /usr/java/jre1.6.0_05/bin/java

9. Port availability

	Port 80, 1935, 40000, 40001, 40002 , 40005 must be free in the machine on which you intend to install Dimdim Web Meeting Server.

	The Dimdim Servers use ports 80 &1935 for external communication. But port 80 alone is enough to be opened for external communication. 
	In addition, ports 40000/ 40001/ 40002 / 40005 must be free for internal communication.


	
	
DIMDIM INSTALLATION:
====================

Installation Steps:

Step 1: Download dimdim rpm package


Step 2: Install rpm package by typing the command rpm -ivh Dimdim-4.5_SF_i386.rpm in a terminal


	Dimdim-4.5 will be installed under location /usr/local and a soft link for dimdim will be created under /usr/local. 
	      
        The place holder will exactly look like 
        --- usr
          |
          |--local
          	|
          	|--dimdim
          		|
          		|--ConferenceServer
			|
          		|--CobrowsingManager
          		|
          		|--DTP3
          		|
          		|--MediaServer
          		|
          		|--red5
          		|
          		|--nginx
			|
			|--ThirdPartyPackages

        		


Step 3: By default, ip address of ethernet 0 interface of the box is configured for Dimdim Server. 

   
	i) To stop Dimdim, open a terminal and enter stopDimdim
	ii) To start Dimdim, open a terminal and enter startDimdim. 
	
	To start the meeting do 
	http://<ipaddress>/dimdim/

Note: If the ip address is not the same or if you need to configure with different IP address, follow the below steps:

Step A:	Get the IP Address of the machine
 
 	Example:
      		root@localhost dimdim]# ifconfig eth0
     		
      		The output will look like:
	         	  eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:0C:29:CA:FA:7C
		          inet addr:192.168.1.10  Bcast:125.255.255.255  Mask:255.0.0.0
		
		The IP Address for the above example is 192.168.1.10
			


Step b: Configure all the Dimdim components
		
		There may be two cases:
		1. Network has public and private IP mapping,
			
			ExternalIP:port --> Internal:port	
			
				Please note that port should be same, Port 80 is recommended. 
				For example: 123.X.X.X:80 ---> 192.168.X.X:80
					publicIP is mapped to privateIP
			
			Use Config-ipaddress.pl like below
				cd /usr/local/dimdim
				./Config-ipaddress.pl 123.X.X.X 80 192.168.X.X
		
		2. VM has a singleIP, There is no network mapping(no Network Address Translation):
			
			Use Config-ipaddress.pl like below
				cd /usr/local/dimdim
				./Config-ipaddress.pl 123.X.X.X 80 

Step c: On completion of configuration, open a terminal and enter the command "startDimdim". This will start all the Dimdim components. 
To ensure all Dimdim Components are started, check the status of the Dimdim Components.

You are now ready to start meeting. Start the meeting by providing the URL http://<IPAddressORHostnameConfigured>/dimdim/. 
Please note the trailing slash is required in the URL after dimdim.Example http://192.168.1.10/dimdim/

Dimdim Sever Machine Restart:
=============================

When the machine where Dimdim Server installed is restarted, 
	open a terminal and type startDimdim - This will start Dimdim Server


Dimdim SMTP Server Configuration :
==================================

Please note that the current smtp settings are just sample setting. It is adviced that you change these settings to your own smtp configuration. 

Below is suggested way to modify the smtp configuration

1) Open dimdim.properties configuration file

Go to folder cd /<dimdim_home>/ConferenceServer/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/webapps/dimdim/WEB-INF/classes/resources/

i.e. cd /usr/local/dimdim/ConferenceServer/apache-tomcat-5.5.17/webapps/dimdim/WEB-INF/classes/resources/


2) Modify the below settings as suggested. Please note that setting "dimdim.smtptype" needs to be configured depending on the type of smtp server.

##	Email Parameters that can be configured by the user. 
##
email.server=<gmail smtp server address>
email.user=<your gmail id>
email.password=<your gmail account password>
email.sender=<your gmail account id>
email.PORT=465
email.EMAIL_CC=
email.EMAIL_BCC=
##

email.EMAIL_REPLY_TO=<your gmail account id>
email.EMAIL_TO=
email.EMAIL_CHARSET=utf-8
##
##
##  This property refers to type of the SMTP Server
##  1 : Non SSL SMTP Server i.e. Dimdim SMTP Server
##  2 : SSL SMTP Server  i.e. gmail SMTP Server
dimdim.smtptype=2
##
##



DIMDIM UNINSTALLATION:
======================

Step 1:	rpm -e 	dimdim

	All the Dimdim Components installed by rpm package will be removed. 


Note:
	    1. Please don't try to change the IP Address or port numbers for the Dimdim components by directly 
	       going to the components' folder. 
	    
	    2. This Dimdim pack is only for 32-bit Operating System machines.
    
    	3. This is tested with CentOS 5.2.
