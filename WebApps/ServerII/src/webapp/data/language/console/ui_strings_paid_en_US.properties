##
##	This file contains all the user visible strings. These include the strings
##	on console, forms and emails which are sent out by the conference server.
##	Purpose of this file is to support a localized ui, by providing locale
##	specific strings.
##
##	The file is a simple properties file with name value pair format. Each
##	section is dedicated to a section of the console screen or an area of the
##	product.
##
##	The string values are used in a single line. Some values may be truncated
##	before their specific use depending on the use. e.g. The tool button labels
##	are truncated to 12 characters, where as messages and email content is not
##	truncated.
