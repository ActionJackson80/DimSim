This is a fork of the recently acquired DimDim software. It is based on the last
publicly released version, 4.1. 

Initial Plans
============

Initial plans are to refactor the code base and annotate as many functions as
possible. Documentation was very poor in the original product the plan is to
try and clean it as we go as well.
