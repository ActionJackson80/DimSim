VERSION	:  	4.1
AUTHOR	:	Bharat Varma N.

1. Presentation Manager is tuned to run behind an nginx server as a FastCGI process with a reverse-proxy configuration.
2. The nginx configuration file will be made available as part of a separate package along with the complete Dimdim codebase.
3. Sample lighttpd configuration files are included with the presentation manager. However, they are written for a setup where presentation manager runs as an SCGI 
	process.
4. Once all the paths are setup under osconfig.py and ldms.conf, all required softlinks for swftools and other dependancies created, use start_pmgr.sh and stop_pmgr.sh
	to start and stop the presentation manager.
