This is a fork of the recently acquired DimDim software. It is based on the last
publicly released version, 4.1. 

## Initial Plans

Initial plans are to refactor the code base and annotate as many functions as
possible. Documentation was very poor in the original product the plan is to
try and clean it as we go as well.

  
## Dependencies

TODO - Incomplete at present including versions of already identified deps
I have just listed here all the dependancies needed to compile. At present
they are all contained in the repository. 

Some of these will be need to be culled from the distribution channel. Ideally
every binary needs to be removed and replaced with an Ant/Ivy or Maven script
to pull in deps and compile.

Priority is to determine which packages are actually needed and which can be
updated to their latest versions.
